## Welcome to MyPeeps


- Using the images provided as a template/guide - built a simple contact list
- On my "home" view, I have shown a list of all of the users in my database.
- When I click on any of the users, I'm routed to a view with that user's info.
- There is a back button/icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
- The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
- All of my data is stored on Parse.com
